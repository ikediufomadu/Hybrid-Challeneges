# LFSR Encryption

The LFSR program demonstrates the use of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) algorithm for encrypting data. It provides a simple example of encrypting data using a given initial value and feedback value.

## Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
    -   Have JDK 20.0.1


## Using the program
To use the LFSR program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the Java source file (LFSR.java) using a Java compiler or terminal:
- javac KDBExtractor.java
2. Run the compiled program:
- java LFSR

The program will output the encrypted data based on the provided example data and initial value.
