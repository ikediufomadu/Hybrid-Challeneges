# KDBExtractor

The KDBExtractor is a Java program designed to extract and decode data from files in a custom format. It utilizes the LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) algorithm to decode encrypted data blocks within the file.

## Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
    -   Have JDK 20.0.1


## Using the program
To use the KDBExtractor, follow these steps:
1. Compile the Java source file (KDBExtractor.java) using a Java compiler or terminal:
    - javac KDBExtractor.java
2. Run the compiled program with the path to the KDB (Key-Data Block) file as a command-line argument:
    - java KDBExtractor <path_to_kdb_file>

## Disclaimer
- I could not fully figure this challenge problem out. I did the best with what I could understand about KDB and the instructions given to me.
